# YOUR NAME
Daniel Dombrovsky 

# STUDENT NUMBER
1211846

# RESOURCES USED
2500 notes, 2520 slides, CIS 2520 course files and functions such as LLvNode.c, .fasta files, etc.

# IMPLEMENTATION STATE
Currently runs both /home/courses/cis2520/data/uniprot_sprot-100000.fasta file and /home/courses/cis2520/data/uniprot_sprot-20000.fasta for all three files on the linux server with no memory leaks/errors.

# SUMMARY
I have learned that having a tail in your linked list is faster so that way you can go directly to the end of the linked list instead of going through the entire list.
